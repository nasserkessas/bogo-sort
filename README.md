# Bogo sort algorithm effectiveness visualiser

## Overview

A script to experimentally visualise the amount of comparisons needed to sort an integer array of varying lengths with the [bogo sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort) algorithm. The bogo sort algorithm randomly permutates an array until it is sorted and is an extremely inefficient algorithm.
